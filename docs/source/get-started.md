# Get started

## Installation

### Come with template

The suggested way to get Notebridge is via [our agent template](https://github.com/lilingxi01/noteaid-agent-template). Notebridge should be included by default in the template, so you don't need to actually install it.

### Via PyPI

Alternatively, you can still install Notebridge via PyPI. Simply run the following command in your terminal (or with any package manager you want, such as poetry):

```bash
pip install notebridge
```

### Via distributable file from GitHub

Alternatively, you can download the distributable file from our GitHub repository and install it manually:

```bash
pip install path/to/notebridge-0.0.0.tar.gz
```
